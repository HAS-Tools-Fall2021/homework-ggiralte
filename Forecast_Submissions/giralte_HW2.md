Assignment 2***

For the week of 9/5/21, by looking at the data in Python, I am guessing that the flow will be 150 cfs. In previous years, around this time, the flow ranged from 90 to 120 cfs but, since Camp Verde had rain this past week and the current flow is about 180 cfs, I'm assuming that the flow will be 150 cfs.

For the following week, since Camp Verde shouldn't be getting much rain this week (if at all), I said the flow would be 90 cfs. Also, historically, the flow has been around 90 to 100 cfs between the 9th and 18th of September.


## Grade:
3/3 - Great job! I like your logic.
