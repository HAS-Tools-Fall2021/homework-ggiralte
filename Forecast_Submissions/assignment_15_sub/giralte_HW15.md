**Assignment 15**

### Grade:
3/3: Great job! You actually don't need to be in interactive mode to submit a job FYI.  

### Reflection:
1) What resources did you request on Puma? \
When I first opened Puma, I had to enter my UA password and then I was able to type in "interactive" to be able to activate my jobs to run. From here, I typed in "sbatch run_python.sh" to get my job to run, however I wasn't in the right directory so I had to enter "ls" to get a list of my folders and then type "cd HAS_tools" to get to the right folder. From here, the "sbatch run_python.sh" worked and my job was queued and it ran!


2) How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run? \
I would say that I probably waited less than 5 minutes in the queue and it actually took about 7 seconds to run.


3) What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Puma? \
The hardest part was making sure the Python ran because we were using Python 3.8 and so there we a couple extra steps that we had to do in order for it to work. And then I also forgot the commands used in Terminal/Puma so I had to email asking about it because I wasn't in the right directory but once I got there, it worked smoothly :)


4) What questions do you still have after doing this? \
I guess it's just hard for me to visualize how you would break up your code to run on different nodes. At this point, I don't even know what I would have to be doing in order to use that (as in what kinds of code I would be running).
