**Assignment 14**
### Question 1:
What is the paper or project you picked? Include a title, a link the the paper and a 1-2 sentence summary of what its about.

Title: The normalised Sentinel-1 Global Backscatter Model, mapping Earthâ€™s land surface with C-band microwaves \
Link to the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01059-7#code-availability \
Link to the repo: https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid \
Summary: The idea of this article/code is to present a new perspective of the Earth's surface based on microwave backscattering.

### Question 2:
What codes and/or data are associated with this paper? Provide any link to the codes and datasets and a 1-2 sentence summary of what was included with the paper (i.e. was it a github repo? A python package? A database? Where was it stored and how?

Link to the repo: https://github.com/TUW-GEO/Equi7Grid \
On the side bar, there is a section for code availability which provides a short description and then a reference link to reference 33 which provides the link to the GitHub repo.

### Question 3:
Summarize your experience trying to understand the repo: Was their readme helpful? How was their organization? What about documentation within the code itself?

I found that their README file was only semi-helpful. It mentioned the main element to install which was Equi7Grid. However, there were no instructions on how to run the code, which codes to run first, and what other packages to install. In the repo, there were other files, such as the "requirements.txt" file, which mention a couple of packages to install which was actually really helpful. However, when I was running through the codes, I came across other packages that I had to install thus that file was only semi-helpful again.

### Question 4:
Summarize your experience trying to work with their repo: What happened when you tried to run it? Where you successful? Why or why not?

At first, when I tried to run their repo, my new VSCode window wasn't connected to my hastools environment so nothing was working. But, once I selected the correct environment, I didn't get any errors. However, I ran all the codes that I could find, which they all ran successfully, but there were no plots or figures that were produced. So, I'm a little confused on what exactly the idea of this repo was if I didn't get any plots/maps to produce.

I did find that it was harder to run these codes because there were no cells! I had to select everything and run it like that. Having cells is a lot more efficient and convenient.

### Question 5:
Summarize your experience working with the data associated with this research. Could you access the data? Where was it? Did it have a DOI? What format was it in?

To be completely honest, I'm not really quite sure where the data came from. I think I was able to access it because there was a folder in the repo named "data" that had some python scripts and a couple files. However, again, I didn't get any plots when I ran the codes. I think the main issue with that is that I maybe didn't run them in the correct sequence but then again, it wasn't clear.

All of the codes were .py files which I found interesting. There were many blocks of comments that I thought would've looked a lot cleaner if they were in Jupyter notebooks due to the Markdown implementation.

### Question 6:
Did this experience teach you anything about your own repo or projects? What suggestions would you give to the authors for how they could do better next time?

This makes me realize how important it is to be thorough and clear with honestly everything when it comes to coding. The repo in the first place was kind of all over the place because it didn't seem very organized. Like mentioned previously, I also thought that the README file wasn't as efficient and effective as it could've been. While it did provide some valuable information, it wasn't all valuable information. It was clear that the authors left out information and key instructions to running the codes and this repo. I believe that more specific instructions should have been added to this repo to help with the ease of running and also for it to be able to be FAIR science and have the plots/figures/results be reproducible.
