**9/20/21** \
**Assignment 4**

I believe that the flow for the week of 9/19 - 9/25 will be 90 cfs based on the fact that the flow this past week was in the higher 90s. For the week of 9/26 to 10/2 I believe that the flow will be 85 cfs because the monsoon season should be over by the end of September and there shouldn't be much rain.

**Question 3:** \
My prediction for the flow for this week is 90 cfs and in the month of September, the flow was greater than 90 cfs 705 times. The flow was greater than 85 cfs 757 times.

**Question 4:** \
Since there were more active monsoon years between 1990 and 2000, the flow would be greater than 90 cfs a lot more frequently than in between 2001 and 2021. However, the data does not agree with this claim in that the cfs was greater than 90 cfs 309 times between 1990 and 2000 and 396 times between 2001 and 2021. This could potentially be due to climate change and an increase in more severe storms. However, due to the lack in the monsoon in frequent years, that's why I presumed that the flow between 1990 and 2000 would be greater.

Between 1990 and 2000, the flow was greater than 85 cfs 314 times and then 443 times for 2001-2021. 

**Question 5:** \
The flow was greater than 90 cfs 368 times for first half of September and 361 times for the second half of September. For the flow of 85 cfs, in the first half of September, the flow was greater 384 times and then 398 times for the second half.
