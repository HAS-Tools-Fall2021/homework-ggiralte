3/3: Great work!
- I don't see your python script submitted here though? Make sure to include that with your submission next time. I found it in your assignment folder but I won't check there in the future.
- Question 4 I think your logic is a bit off in your averaging -- check the answer in the solution provided.

### Prediction Summary:
For the week of 9/12/21 through 9/18/21, I believe that the flow will be 75 cfs because the average flow for last week (9/5 - 9/11) was 118 cfs. The current flow on 9/11/21 is 98.5 cfs. Also, since Camp Verde will not be expecting any rain this week, I believe the flow will decrease to 75 cfs.

For the week of 9/19/21 through 9/25/21, I believe that the flow will be 85 cfs because Camp Verde could be getting some rain later in that week. However, historically, the flow for those dates has been between 100 and 180 so it could really go any way. However, since it might rain, I'm bumping up the flow to 85 cfs in comparison to the week of 9/12 through 9/18.

### Question 1:
The variables `flow`, `year`, `month`, and `day` are lists! Every variable is a integer data type while `flow` is a float data type. The length of each of these lists is 11,576. This is the same case for the variable titled `date`.

### Question 2:
For the first week of September (9/5 - 9/11, second week), I had predicted that the flow would be 120 cfs. Taking all Septembers into consideration (from 1990, so 940 September days from when this was evaluated), the flow was greater than my predicted flow (of 120 cfs) 481 times (51.1%). For my prediction of 9/5 - 9/11 (first week), the flow was greater than 150 cfs 315 times (33.5%). For my prediction of 9/12 - 9/18 (second week), the flow was greater than 90 cfs 698 times (74.2%). For my prediction of 9/12 - 9/18 (first week), the flow was greater than 75 cfs 824 times (87.6%). For my prediction of 9/19 - 9/25 (second week), the flow was greater than 85 cfs 750 times (79.7%).Also, for the week of 8/29 - 9/4, the flow was greater than 175 cfs 229 times (24.3%).

### Question 3:
I would presume that the percentages would be greater because there is a smaller "pool" to pull from. Also, in recent years, there hasn't really been much of a monsoon season so I would expect the percentages for 1990-2000 to be greater but the percentages for 2001-2021 to be lesser.

If you take every September since 1990 until (and including) 2000, the flow was greater than 175 cfs 125 times (330 total days of September) so 37.8% of the time. 168 times for greater than 150 (50.9%). 247 times for greater than 120 (74.8%). 309 times for greater than 90 (93.6%). 314 times for greater than 85 cfs (95.1%). And finally, 320 times for greater than 75 cfs (96.9%).

If you take every September since 2001 until the current date in 2021 (September 11), the flow was greater than 175 cfs only 104 times (out of 610 total days of September) so 17.0% of the time. 147 times for greater than 150 cfs (24.1%). 234 times for greater than 120 cfs (38.3%). 389 times for greater than 90 cfs (63.7%). 436 times for greater than 85 cfs (71.4%). And finally, 504 times for greater than 75 cfs (82.6%).

### Question 4:
Since 1990, the average daily flow for the first half of September has historically been greater than the average daily flow for the second half of September. This would make sense because the monsoon season ends around the end of September and so there wouldn't be as much rain (typically) as you neared the end of September. In some cases, there were drastic differences between the first half of September and the second half while in a couple cases, there were only differences by a couple of cfs.
